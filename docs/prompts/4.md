TODO:
- Fix PUT /posts?id={} to PUT /posts/:id
- Pass full Config to PostController instead of just pageSizeLimit
- Add .example.env with default values of all config parameters
- Move “http” folder to “internal/http”
- Fix bug: post row is not actually removed from html after “delete” button is clicked and API returned 200 OK.
- Fix bug: post delete confirmation is not shown, so this does not work: “hx-confirm="Are you sure you want to delete this post?"
- Fix bug: Post search does not work. Failed with js error: “Failed to execute 'fetch' on 'Window': Request with GET/HEAD method cannot have body”
- Set default pagination page size limit to 10
- Add GitHub action with build/test steps
